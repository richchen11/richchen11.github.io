    "Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a competitive PC game developed by Valve Corporation in 2012. It is part of a franchise of games stretching back to the release of the first Counter-Strike in 2000. CS:GO is played in a first person perspective, in which two teams of 5 players compete to see who wins a total of 16 rounds the fastest. For the first 15 rounds of the game, one side will play an offensive side that is tasked with planting and bomb and having it detonate. The other side is tasked with defusing the bomb or preventing it from being planted at all. Both teams can also win the round by eliminating all enemy players. In case both teams draw at the 30th round on 15-15, 6 more rounds are added as overtime; ends if a team wins 4 out of 6 rounds. At any point, there are 7 active maps in the competitive pool. Overall matches are played in a **best of 3 maps** to see who wins the series overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the competitive nature of the game, a professional circuit has thrived over the past 8 years. With record player numbers in the base game (1.1 million concurrent players), and increased investment from traditional North American sports franchises, such as the Dallas Cowboys, CS:GO might be a sneak preview into the **future of entertainment**. Having a predictive model of how a competitive CS:GO team can be successful could be worth **millions** as the industry becomes more mainstream. Success in this model could open more opportunities for the broader sport of esports. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I will be analyzing a dataset from Kaggle Datasets. I will be going step-by-step through the data pipeline of professional CS:GO teams to determine winning trends and strategies. My goal is to lay the framework and an example for others to build upon when analyzing a competitive multiplayer game. This tutorial and analysis will be written with Python 3 in mind."
